# Decisions — Dev Tooling

## Hidden dev panel, not a public settings page

- **Decision.** All tuning controls, sim-drive knobs, and diagnostic readouts
  live in a hidden overlay (`?dev=1` / backtick / gear button) rather than the
  public UI.
- **Why.** The public surface is intentionally minimal — just the visualisation,
  transport, and top-level toggles. Exposing dozens of sliders or review
  presets to all visitors adds visual noise and invites accidental mis-tuning.
  The hidden panel gives developers full access without polluting the product
  surface.
- **Applies to.** [`../architecture/dev-panel.md`](../architecture/dev-panel.md).
- **Code anchors.** `web/src/ui/dev-panel.ts → DevPanel` (open triggers);
  `web/src/main.ts` (wires the gear button via `onVisibilityChange`).

## Colored-dot impact classification as the single source of truth

- **Decision.** Every control in the panel carries a colored dot (green =
  live / yellow = brain-reset / red = renderer-rebuild) whose color comes
  exclusively from `web/src/core/setting-metadata.ts → SETTING_IMPACT`. No other file
  makes impact decisions.
- **Why.** With 24 settings spread across multiple tabs and potentially
  multiple UIs, a single classification table prevents drift between the visual
  hint and the actual apply path. Adding a control means adding one entry to
  `SETTING_IMPACT`; no other coordination needed.
- **Applies to.** [`../architecture/dev-panel.md`](../architecture/dev-panel.md).
- **Tradeoffs.** The table is a flat `Record<keyof VisualizerSettings,
  SettingImpact>`; it does not express per-value conditions (e.g. "live unless
  changing from 0"). That granularity has not been needed.

## Most settings are live; rebuild-only controls stay explicit

- **Decision.** Most `VisualizerSettings` fields are `"live"`, but
  `connectionCurveLift` stays `"renderer-rebuild"` and the descriptor-driven
  morphology generator/render-quality groups are still rebuild-backed. The
  region-assignment prototype is an `AppConfig` dev-panel checkbox, not a
  `VisualizerSettings` field, and also rebuilds through the worker-prepared
  network path. The old brain-reset Apply API and pending UI are removed;
  rebuilds go through the network/morphology rebuild controls.
- **Why.** `heterogeneity`, `weightNormalization`, and `inputMode` are `"live"`
  because the integrate uniform is read from GPU memory every tick rather than
  cached at init. `connectionCurveLift` and the morphology generator/quality
  controls still change baked geometry or WGSL overrides, so keeping them
  explicit avoids pretending they are cheap live knobs. Removing the no-op Apply
  surface avoids suggesting there is a second rebuild path.
- **Applies to.** [`../architecture/dev-panel.md`](../architecture/dev-panel.md).
- **Revisit when.** A truly structural setting is added (e.g. one that changes
  buffer sizes or requires re-uploading connectivity).

## Versioned localStorage with merge-over-defaults; static hidden review presets only

- **Decision.** Dev-panel settings persist under a versioned key
  (`bv2_settings_v2`), morphology config persists under `bv2_morph_v2`, and app
  runtime config persists under `bv2_config_v2`; this includes the hidden
  region-assignment review mode. On load, saved fields are merged over defaults
  field-by-field with `?? base` guards. There is still no
  public preset manager; the only presets are the static hidden review buttons
  `accepted-default`, `performance-review`, and `hero-review` in the Storage tab.
- **Why.** Merge-over-defaults means adding a new field is safe without a
  version bump and without migration logic: the new field simply falls back to
  its default for existing saves. A version bump is reserved for semantically
  breaking changes (repurposed indices, changed defaults) where old data would
  actively mislead. Morphology loading also filters each group to known current
  fields, and app config normalizes stale backend values to GPU, so obsolete
  config keys from older saves are ignored rather than sent back to Rust. The
  review presets cover the reproducibility need without growing a user-editable
  preset system.
- **Applies to.** [`../architecture/dev-panel.md`](../architecture/dev-panel.md).
- **Code anchors.** `web/src/core/settings.ts → loadSettings, mergeOver, resetSettings`;
  `web/src/core/morph-config.ts → loadMorphConfig, resetMorphConfig`;
  `web/src/core/types.ts → loadConfig, resetConfig`;
  `web/src/ui/dev-panel.ts → HIDDEN_REVIEW_PRESETS`.
- **Tradeoffs.** Default changes do not automatically reset old saved
  visual/morph values unless the version sentinel is bumped. App config is the
  exception for scale safety: saved `n` is clamped to the product cap on
  load/save.

## Region assignment mode stays in AppConfig, not VisualSettings

- **Decision.** The anterior/posterior region prototype toggle lives in
  `AppConfig.regionAssignmentMode` and is sent with worker-prepared network
  requests; it is not added to the `VisualizerSettings` Float32Array or to the
  morphology JSON config.
- **Why.** Region assignment is a build-time structural choice that changes the
  generated per-neuron region codes. It does not belong in the live uniform
  settings array, and putting it there would risk the frozen positional index
  contract for a value Rust only consumes during preparation.
- **Applies to.** [`../architecture/dev-panel.md`](../architecture/dev-panel.md),
  [`../architecture/web-frontend.md`](../architecture/web-frontend.md),
  [`../architecture/manifold.md`](../architecture/manifold.md).
- **Code anchors.** `web/src/core/types.ts → AppConfig, normalizeRegionAssignmentMode`;
  `web/src/ui/dev-panel.ts → _buildNetworkTab`;
  `web/src/gpu-build/prepared-network.ts → PreparedNetworkRequest`;
  `crates/brain-visualizer/src/lib.rs → prepare_network_payload`.

## Morphology config on a separate key + WASM entry point, not the Float32Array

- **Decision.** The dev-panel morphology config (generator / render-quality /
  lighting) persists under its own `bv2_morph_v2` localStorage key and reaches
  the backend through a dedicated `set_morphology_config(json)` WASM entry point
  that takes a JSON string — **not** by adding slots to the `VisualSettings`
  Float32Array or to `bv2_settings_v2`. The boot path queues the persisted
  morphology config before backend creation and again after backend creation, so
  Rust receives it without any slider interaction. The dev panel renders its rows
  from a typed descriptor array (`MORPH_DESCRIPTORS`) rather than bespoke
  per-control code, and descriptor defaults must match `DEFAULT_MORPH_CONFIG`.
- **Why.** The 26-slot Float32Array index contract is a frozen, corruption-prone
  Rust↔TS boundary (see Float32Array decision below); the morphology config is a
  larger, nested, evolving surface where adding/removing a field should not risk
  silently shifting every other visual setting. A separate JSON channel lets the
  Rust side deserialize by name (serde), diff incoming vs current, and run the
  narrowest update (uniform-only for lighting; regenerate for generator; pipeline
  rebuild for render-quality) — none of which fits a flat positional float array.
  Descriptor-driven rows keep adding a control to a single array entry.
- **Applies to.** [`../architecture/dev-panel.md`](../architecture/dev-panel.md),
  [`../architecture/web-frontend.md`](../architecture/web-frontend.md),
  [`../architecture/manifold.md`](../architecture/manifold.md).
- **Code anchors.** `web/src/core/morph-config.ts → MORPH_DESCRIPTORS, MorphologyConfig, loadMorphConfig`;
  `crates/brain-visualizer/src/lib.rs → WasmGpuBackend::set_morphology_config`;
  `crates/brain-visualizer/src/sim/gpu/mod.rs → GpuBackend::set_morphology_config`.
- **Tradeoffs.** Two persistence keys and two backend channels to keep coherent
  (the reset path must clear both); a JSON round-trip per apply instead of a raw
  byte slice. Acceptable — morphology config is applied on explicit edits, not
  per-frame.

## Numeric dev controls share one slider/input/reset widget

- **Decision.** Rendering and morphology numeric controls use the shared
  slider + number input + reset button + instant-tooltip helper in
  `web/src/ui/dev-panel.ts`; morphology rows remain descriptor-driven.
- **Why.** Tiny morphology ranges are not usable as drag-only sliders, and reset
  buttons are only trustworthy when they read the same defaults the backend sees.
  A shared helper keeps the panel's numeric controls mechanically consistent
  while preserving the existing impact-dot model.
- **Applies to.** [`../architecture/dev-panel.md`](../architecture/dev-panel.md).
- **Code anchors.** `web/src/ui/dev-panel.ts → _sliderWithInput, _sliderRow,
  _morphRow`; `web/src/core/morph-config.ts → MORPH_DESCRIPTORS`; `web/src/ui/dev-panel.test.ts`.

## Tombstone or quarantine dead Float32Array slots instead of renumbering

- **Decision.** `connectionLightPast` (index 9), `bloomStrength` as a user
  setting (index 10), `signalSource` (index 16), and `adaptiveScalerEnabled`
  (index 23) are removed from UI/debug persistence paths and zero-written, but
  the 26-slot `VisualSettings` array is not renumbered. `pointRadius` (index 1),
  `surfaceOpacity` (index 11), and `surface` (index 20) are also removed from
  UI/persistence and default-written rather than renumbered or exposed.
- **Why.** Renumbering the Rust/TypeScript flat-array contract is a corruption
  risk with little payoff. Tombstoning/quarantining removes misleading controls
  while keeping old positional meaning stable and keeping dormant Rust render
  paths available for explicit future work.
- **Applies to.** [`../architecture/dev-panel.md`](../architecture/dev-panel.md),
  [`../architecture/gpu-rendering.md`](../architecture/gpu-rendering.md).
- **Code anchors.** `web/src/core/settings.ts → SavedDev, toFloat32Array`;
  `web/src/ui/dev-panel.ts → _buildRenderingTab, _buildDebugViewTab`;
  `crates/brain-visualizer/src/sim/gpu/mod.rs → VisualSettings::from_slice`.

## Version-reset over migration for semantically breaking default changes

- **Decision.** When a wave of default changes would cause old saved values to
  actively mislead — such as high-excitability/high-`iExt` saves masking the
  new quiet-network defaults — the LS key version string is bumped (e.g.
  `bv2_settings_v1` → `bv2_settings_v2`) rather than writing migration logic.
  All three keys were bumped together in the high-scale defaults wave.
- **Why.** A migration that rewrites old high-excitability saves to the new
  low-firing defaults is indistinguishable from a reset for the user; a version
  bump is simpler, audit-proof, and has no edge cases. The cost is that saved
  visual preferences are discarded — acceptable for a dev-tool panel where users
  can re-tune in a few seconds. The merge-over-defaults shape means the reset
  leaves the user on the new clean defaults immediately.
- **Applies to.** [`../architecture/dev-panel.md`](../architecture/dev-panel.md).
- **Code anchors.** `web/src/core/settings.ts → SETTINGS_LS_KEY`;
  `web/src/core/morph-config.ts → MORPH_CONFIG_LS_KEY`;
  `web/src/core/types.ts → CONFIG_LS_KEY`.

## Expose only bounded runtime-safe morphology knobs

- **Decision.** The dev panel exposes only a small, bounded set of new
  morphology generator knobs at runtime. Decoration controls are capped by
  their compile-time maxima, and straight-subdivision controls are clamped to
  the already-budgeted `EDGE_SUBSEGMENTS_MAX`. Allocation budgets, salts, and
  waypoint counts remain protected.
- **Why.** The GPU morphology buffers are pre-allocated to fixed maxes at
  pipeline build time. Changing a buffer-sized parameter without resizing the
  buffer silently drops segments or overruns memory. The exposed subdivision
  knobs only vary how much of the existing per-hop cap is used, so they can make
  turns smoother/coarser without changing buffer sizing.
- **Applies to.** [`../architecture/dev-panel.md`](../architecture/dev-panel.md),
  [`../architecture/gpu-rendering.md`](../architecture/gpu-rendering.md).
- **Code anchors.** `web/src/core/morph-config.ts → MORPH_DESCRIPTORS`;
  `crates/brain-visualizer/src/sim/morphology.rs → GeneratorConfig::apply_to,
  MorphologyParams::locked_default`.
- **Revisit when.** The pipeline rebuild path accepts dynamic buffer sizes, or a
  separate "needs-rebuild" flow is added for buffer-sized changes.

## Task-oriented settings IA over one oversized rendering tab

- **Decision.** The dev panel uses Monitor / Dynamics / Network / Appearance /
  Morphology / Debug / Storage tabs. Appearance owns live visual settings and
  morphology lighting; Morphology owns descriptor-driven generator/render-quality
  config; Debug is read-only current-state labels.
- **Why.** The old Rendering tab mixed color, glow, connection visibility,
  morphology generation, lighting, reach, quality, and stale surface state. A
  task-oriented split keeps live tuning surfaces easier to trust while letting
  advanced/debug capability remain hidden rather than deleted wholesale. Lighting
  controls (uniform/live) sit in Appearance because they feel like live render
  knobs, not geometry parameters; generator/quality controls (rebuild-backed)
  stay in Morphology where users expect to rebuild.
- **Applies to.** [`../architecture/dev-panel.md`](../architecture/dev-panel.md).
- **Code anchors.** `web/src/ui/dev-panel.ts → TABS, _buildAppearanceTab,
  _buildMorphLightingRows, _buildMorphConfigRows, _buildDebugViewTab`.

## Custom instant tooltips, not native `title=`

- **Decision.** Dev-panel controls and metric rows use a custom zero-delay
  tooltip: a single floating `.dp-tooltip` element appended to `<body>` and
  positioned by two delegated `mouseover`/`mouseout` listeners on `document`
  keyed off a `data-tip` attribute. Native `title=` and CSS `::after` tooltips
  are not used.
- **Why.** Native `title=` waits ~1 s before showing — too slow for a dense
  panel where hovering to learn what a control does should be instant. A CSS
  `::after` tooltip would be clipped by the panel's scrolling container; a
  body-appended floating element is not. Delegated listeners mean adding a tip
  to a new control is a single `_attachTip` call (no per-element wiring).
- **Applies to.** [`../architecture/dev-panel.md`](../architecture/dev-panel.md).
- **Code anchors.** `web/src/ui/dev-panel.ts → _buildTooltip, _attachTip`.

## Float32Array index contract is the shared Rust/TS boundary

- **Decision.** The 26-element `Float32Array` produced by
  `web/src/core/settings.ts → toFloat32Array` and consumed by
  `crates/brain-visualizer/src/sim/gpu/mod.rs → VisualSettings::from_slice` is the sole settings
  boundary between the JS and Rust worlds. Index assignment is the contract;
  both files carry authoritative inline comments and executable contract tests.
  Removed settings reserve their existing indices and are zero/default-written
  rather than shifting later slots.
- **Why.** WASM passes a raw byte slice — there is no named-field protocol.
  Using a flat array with documented indices is simpler than building a
  serialisation layer, and the `from_slice` implementation is length-tolerant
  (new indices fall back to defaults), making forward-compatibility cheap.
- **Applies to.** [`../architecture/dev-panel.md`](../architecture/dev-panel.md),
  [`../architecture/gpu-backend.md`](../architecture/gpu-backend.md).
- **Code anchors.** `web/src/core/settings.ts → toFloat32Array`;
  `crates/brain-visualizer/src/sim/gpu/mod.rs → VisualSettings::from_slice`.
- **Tradeoffs.** The flat array is still less self-describing than JSON, so
  changes require synchronized Rust and TypeScript edits. The guardrail is
  duplicated explicit golden tests instead of shared generated schema plumbing,
  which keeps the current contract small and reviewable.
